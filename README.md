Snake game 

 Is a popular game in which the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat food while avoiding walls and its own tail. As the snake eats more food, it grows longer, making the game more challenging.

In Python, we can build the Snake Game using the Turtle module, which is a simple graphics library. Turtle provides tools for drawing and movement, making it an excellent fit for this game, where the snake moves around the screen and grows in size.

Key Concepts for Building the Snake Game:

Snake Movement: The snake is represented by a series of segments, and it moves in a direction based on player input (up, down, left, right).

Food: The snake eats food to grow. The food appears at random positions on the screen.

Collision INDetection: The game ends if the snake hits the wall it moved to other end

Collision Detection: collides with its own body.

Score Tracking: The player's score increases as the snake eats more food
